# Java Project - Weather

## Project Background

The Airport Weather Service (AWS) is a REST application for collecting and redistributing meteorological data for a handful of airports. The service provides two distinct interfaces. One is a query interface, used by dozens of client systems to retrieve information such mean temperature and max wind speed. The other is a collector interface used by airpots to update meteorological data stored in AWS. You'll find more detail about these interfaces in WeatherCollectorEndpoint.java and WeatherQueryEndpoint.java. To see the service in action, you can run the included run-ws.sh which launches the server and demonstrates a simple client hitting the REST endpoint.

Over time, the number of airports and clients of the service has grown. Today, the application finds itself filling a role much larger than it was initially designed for - resulting in poor reliability and slow performance. Your task is to apply best practices to the code and fix design defects, while keeping in mind that since this is a live application, you must be careful not to change external interfaces.

### REST API

The application currently supports the following REST APIs, you should not change the parameters or response format, but may change the implementation.
* GET /collect/ping
* POST /collect/weather/{iata}/{pointType}
* GET /query/ping
* GET /query/weather/{iata}/{radius}

Unimplemented REST APIs
* POST /collect/airport/{iata}/{lat}/{long}
* DELETE /collect/airport/{iata}

## Assignment Objectives
Your goal, as an experienced software engineer, is to apply java development best practices and convention to the AWS code. You should modify the code to follow the patterns in the java world, restructure the code so that it's easier to work with, but keep in mind that the result needs to retain the REST API spec established in the first version.

### Part 1 - Take ownership and update to best practices
The code is now *your* code - change it to meet professional coding standards. You should take this opportunity to fix obvious logic and concurrency bugs. You may update data structures as necessary, but changing the external contract will result in an automatic failure on the assignment.

### Part 2 - Add a new feature
Now that the code is cleaned up, it's time to add a feature. The feature to implement, which you may have noticed in your code review, is that airports are hard coded. You should implement the ```[POST|DELETE] /collect/airport``` endpoints. You should also create an ```AirportLoader``` which will read airports.dat and call your endpoint. The application will need to support at least 1000 unique airports.

A sample airports.dat is included with the trial, but a more complete airport.dat will be used to evaluate your work. The airports.dat is a comma separated file with the following headers:

Header   	| Description
------------|------------
City		| Main city served by airport. May be spelled differently from name.
Country		| Country or territory where airport is located.
IATA/FAA 	| 3-letter FAA code or IATA code (blank or "" if not assigned)
ICAO		| 4-letter ICAO code (blank or "" if not assigned)
Latitude 	| Decimal degrees, up to 6 significant digits. Negative is South, positive is North.
Longitude	| Decimal degrees, up to 6 significant digits. Negative is West, positive is East.
Altitude	| In feet
Timezone	| Hours offset from UTC. Fractional hours are expressed as decimals. (e.g. India is 5.5)
DST			| One of E (Europe), A (US/Canada), S (South America), O (Australia), Z (New Zealand), N (None) or U (Unknown) 

## Solution Requirements
1.  You should not change any public REST interfaces (this is your final warning, doing so is an automatic failure)
2.  You should assume we will build, test and run using the latest released version of JDK1.8 and maven 3.x on the linux platform
3.  You should follow the overall project submission guidelines provided in the assignment description for correct packaging

## Scoring
1. Correctness (40%) 
  * Any submission that does not build fails the included unit tests will not be graded.
  * The assignment contains a DoNotChangeTest.java test cases. As the name implies, you should not change this test case.
  * Your submission will be launched and a series of automated tests will be executed against the REST API. 40% of your score is determined by how many of these tests pass.
2. Code Quality (60%)
  * Standards Adherence - code is read many more time than it is written and those candidates with the professional experience to understand this generally make every effort to make sure their code is well formatted and easy to read. This includes: following typical java standards for naming and documentation, using common conventions when using libraries and organizing code logically into reusable methods.
  * Testing - Unit testing and coverage of both success and failure paths, this also means writing code that is unit testable.
  * Code Complexity - code that has minimal branching, avoids large loops and uses built in java libraries carefully will score better

## Delivery / What to submit

### Packaging Your Code
Once you're done, run the provided package.sh, which will create add pom.xml, src, package.sh and run-ws.sh to a submittable zip file. You'll need to rename the zip, to *AWS-{last_name}\_{first_name}.zip*

### Verifying your deliverable
Although optional, we suggest extracting your final deliverable into a new directory to make sure it builds and tests pass.

Good luck!
